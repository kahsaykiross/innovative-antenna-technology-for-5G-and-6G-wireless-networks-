# Innovative Antenna Technologies for 5G and 6G Wireless Networks

This repository contains the research and Python-based simulations for  
**"Innovative Antenna Technologies for 5G and 6G Wireless Networks"**,  
authored by **Kahsay Kiross Meresa**.  

The project investigates **Massive MIMO**, **Beamforming**, **Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS)**,  
and **AI-driven antenna optimization** as cornerstones of next-generation communication.  
All models and simulations are developed **entirely from scratch using Python** ‚Äî without relying on external communication toolboxes.

## üåê Overview

As 5G expands and 6G approaches, antenna technologies must address:  
- High-frequency mmWave and THz band challenges  
- Ultra-low latency and high reliability requirements  
- Massive IoT and device connectivity  
- Energy efficiency and green communication  

This project builds **original Python implementations** to explore:  

- **Massive MIMO**: From scratch models for capacity and spectral efficiency.  
- **Beamforming**: Code to steer beams dynamically and visualize radiation patterns.  
- **RIS**: Metasurface-based reflection modeling and optimization.  
- **AI-driven optimization**: Python-native ML models for adaptive antenna tuning.
